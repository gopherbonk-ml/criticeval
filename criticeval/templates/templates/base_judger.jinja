You are a strict grader. Evaluate whether the LLM's answer solves the problem.

Problem:
{{ task }}

Reference solution:
{{ target_solution | default("N/A") }}

Reference answer:
{{ target_answer | default("N/A") }}

LLM solution:
{{ solver_solution | default("N/A") }}

LLM answer:

{{ solver_answer | default("N/A") }}

Decide if the LLM solution is correct. If incorrect, briefly explain why.
Rate the LLM solution with a binary score (0 or 1), where 0 means the solution is incorrect and 1 means the solution is correct. Place your score (0 or 1) in the \\boxed{}. Example \\boxed{0}
